            <p class="LBPText">Last night, my brother prepared a lovely feast for my family again! He prepared pan fried Wagyu beef steak along with some grilled baby potatoes, a simple garden salad and homemade mushroom soup. The meal was absolutely delightful and the beef was extremely tender. Not to mention the grilled baby potatoes and the garden salad really complemented the beef perfectly. I also loved the salad as it is simple and not overly complicated and tasted light and refreshing. The meal was completed with the homemade mushroom soup which was really to my liking. The soup was not too thick but at the same time had some starchiness to it. There was also small bits of mushrooms which added some flavour and added dynamic to the soup. I think that the ingredients are slightly pricey but overall, this meal would've cost a lot more if you were to order the same dishes outside. Moreover, the atmosphere in the comfort of your own home and company of family members is definitely prefarable to a restaurant. I would give the presentation of this meal a 7/10 as it is not very great as it is homemade. The meal itself deserves solid 9/10 as the steak was perfectly cooked, extremely tender and juicy with the hint of salt, pepper and rosemary. The baby potatoes were soft and the fragrance of the herbs can be tasted when eating it. The salad was also good as it was simple. Paired with some salad dressing, it was very refreshing and also crunchy.
