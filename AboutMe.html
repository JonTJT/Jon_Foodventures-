            <img class="Me " src="images/Me&Nirvain.jpg " alt="Me ">
            <p class="AboutmeContent "> My name is Jon Tan, I am 17 this year, currently pursuing a diploma in Infocomm Security Management in Singapore Polytechnic. As you may already have guessed, im a real foodie and I enjoy sharing good food with others and enjoying a good meal with friends and family. Other than that, I also enjoy photography, as I like to capture beautiful sceneries and enjoy the sense of satisfaction I get when i take a beautiful photo. My favourite quote is one by Bill Watterson. “We're so busy watching out for what's just ahead of us that we don't take time to enjoy where we are.” as it resonates with me as I like to enjoy life as it is and living in the present. </p>
            <img class="Fries " src="images/Fries.jpg " alt="Fries ">
            <p class="AboutmeContent2 "> I created this blog because of my love of food. I love food as it provides comfort for me when I am stressed out , tired or just hungry and want to grab something to eat. I also wanted to use this blog as a medium for me to look back on all the food and the journey of me in the future as I can look back and look at all the great food and experiences I had. Nonetheless, the main purpose of this blog is for me to share with you the wonderful food this world has to offer! Thanks for patronising my website and I hope you have a wonderful time here!</p>
            <img class="Hobby " src="images/Pool.jpg" alt="Pool ">
            <p class="AboutmeContent3 "> I also enjoy doing other things such as playing computer games, playing pool and running. I like playing computer games as I am a very competitive person and I like to play computer games to destress as it is more interactive than just watching movies or dramas. I also enjoy playing pool as it is a good opportunity to catch up with friends or just to have friendly games between friends to strengthen the friendship and catch up with each others lives. It is also fun and what I enjoy the most of the game is the sense of satisfaction when you pot balls. I also like running as it helps me to think better and helps me to build disclipline. </p>
